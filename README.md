This project serves as a practical demonstration of essential Python and data analytics skills acquired during the course. The primary focus is on introducing a new data prediction algorithm that was not covered in the class. I chose to utilize Random Forest Regressor. This task requires a deep dive into the workings of the algorithm, its suitability for various prediction tasks, and a nuanced evaluation of its strengths and weaknesses.

Following the algorithm introduction, the project emphasizes the application of this algorithm to a personally chosen dataset. This practical application stage underscores the proficiency in implementing best practices for data cleaning and feature engineering, showcasing a robust grasp of Python and data analytics skills. My choice and implementation of the dataset and algorithm worked very well in this project, with an R-squared score of 0.9999999997724306%, on a 0-1 scale.
